## Project Introduction

Magisk-Tailscaled-GUI is an Android application written in Kotlin that provides a graphical interface for Magisk-Tailscaled and integrates the TailDrop feature.  
Since I have no prior Android-development experience, the vast majority of the code was generated by ChatGPT; therefore, instability may occur.

## Features

- **One-Tap Control** – Quickly start/stop the Tailscale service and Drop service  
- **Status Monitoring** – Real-time display of local-device and peer status  
- **File Transfer** – Convenient Drop functionality built on top of Magisk-Tailscaled  
- **Quick Settings** – One-click login/logout, common-parameter toggles, and custom-parameter support

### Planned Features
